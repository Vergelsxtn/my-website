                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p><b>Hi, I’m Vergel!</b><br>I’m a Filipino artist and coder living in the Philippines, blending creativity and technology to craft unique digital experiences. My journey began with a fascination for both the visual and logical sides of creation. Art for its power to evoke emotions and coding for its ability to bring ideas to life.
                    <br>Art has always been a part of me, it’s how I express ideas and bring imagination to life. On the coding side, I love solving puzzles and building things that make life more exciting. Combining these two worlds, I enjoy creating dynamic digital experiences, from artwork to programming.
                    <br><br>My ultimate dream is to create my own game that will be loved by both players and art lovers alike. I’m passionate about making something that connects with others and sparks happiness through both its gameplay and artistic vision.</p>
